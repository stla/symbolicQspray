Description: Introduces the 'symbolicQspray' objects. Such an object
    defines a multivariate polynomial whose coefficients are fractions of
    multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients. The package
    allows arithmetic on such polynomials. It is based on the 'qspray' and 
    'ratioOfQsprays' packages. Some functions for 'qspray' polynomials have
    their counterpart for 'symbolicQspray' polynomials. A 'symbolicQspray' 
    polynomial should not be seen as a polynomial on the field of fractions 
    of rational polynomials, but should rather be seen as a polynomial with 
    rational coefficients depending on some parameters, with a dependence 
    given by fractions of rational polynomials.
