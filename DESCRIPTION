Description: Introduces the 'symbolicQspray' objects. Such an object
    defines a multivariate polynomial whose coefficients are fractions of
    multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients. The package
    allows arithmetic on such polynomials. It is based on the 'qspray' and 
    'ratioOfQsprays' packages. Some functions from the 'qspray' package are 
    applicable to 'symbolicQspray' objects.
